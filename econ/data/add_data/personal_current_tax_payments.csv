Legend/Footnotes
"1. Excludes estate and gift taxes, which are classified in the NIPAs as capital transfers."
"2. Estimates of personal current tax receipts do not include deductions for federal refundable tax credits. The amounts by which federal refundable tax credits reduce personal current tax liabilities are recorded in the NIPAs as social benefits to persons, not as reductions to personal current tax receipts"
3. Consists of the dividends tax in 1933-34 and of the automobile use tax in 1942-46.
4. Consists of taxes on personal and intangible property paid by households. Taxes on real property are included in taxes on production and imports to reflect the NIPA treatment of owner-occupied housing as if it were a rental business (Table 3.5).
"5. Consists largely of hunting, fishing, and other personal licenses."
